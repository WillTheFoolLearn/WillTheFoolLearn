- 👋 Hi, I’m @WillTheFoolLearn
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new things by picking a new project and jumping into it.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML/CSS. I plan to expand much more with Python next and others to follow.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment. I'm just getting my feet wet.
- 📫 How to reach me @willthefoollearn is used everywhere.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm not entirely certain if anything I do will need GitHub in the first place. Setting it up just in case.
